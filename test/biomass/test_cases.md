# Test cases
For all tests, check for:
- correct product type(s)
- correct product (directory) names, files and file names
- correct valid start/stop times (part of dir/file names)

## RAW_xxx_10
Raw data.
This is generated by the tool itself. Valid times, product types etc are defined
in the scenario.
Generate RAW_022_10, RAW_023_10, RAW_024_10, RAW_025_10 and RAW_026_10 product.

## RAWSxxx_10
Raw sliced data. Input products are 'sliced' according to grid, as defined.
- step1, workspace 1. Check for 
  - correct slice start/stop times

## Sx_RAW__0S, Sx_RAWP_0M
Sliced L0 products.
Data takes defined in scenario.

- step2a, workspace 1000. Normal scenario. Check for 
  - correct MPH fields:
    - data take
    - incomplete slice
    - swath ID
  - correct product type (derived from swath)
- step2b, workspace 1001. Incomplete slice. Check for correct MPH fields:
  - incomplete_slice flag
- step2c. Split raw slices containing different data take IDs in multiple products
  - two output products should be generated, with different data take IDs
  - but with the same slice nr -TODO-! 
- step2d. Merge raw slices from separate dumps
- step2e. Slicing off (see L0 product definition, p15) should produce ...? What? Combine raw data? 

## EC_RAWP_0S
TODO

## Sx_RAW__0M, RO_RAW__0M, EC_RAW__0M
Preliminairy products.
- normal scenario should produce
  - correct product names/files
  - correct metadata fields (data take)
- with multiple products
  - should take the earliest and latest validity time and produce a single 'merged' product
  - optional: check for data take id

## AC_RAW__0A
Provides orbit and attitude information from AOCS.
- normal scenario should produce
  - correct product names/files
  - correct metadata fields
